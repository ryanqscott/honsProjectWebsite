			<h2>Morphological Complexity (HyperNEAT-M)</h2>

		<h3>Background and Context</h3>
		<p>The choice of Evolutionary Algorithm can play a big role in outcome of results when used. As such, the testing of a hypothesis involving an evolutionary algorithm should be tested again, using a different one, to ensure that the choice of algorithm didn't influence the results of the experiment. HyperNEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that uses the unique geometric properties of the problem, in tandem with it's indirect encoding (through CPPNs) to produce much larger networks than other algorithms.</p>
		<p>It has been observed that there is far more work that has been done in experimenting with co-evolving controllers/behaviour (minds) and morphology for single robots and much less work has been done for cooperative or multi-robot systems. The choice of investigating a multi-robot problem was thus to broaden this field and promote additional interest in this growing area.</p>
		<h3>Project Goals</h3>
		<p>The aim of this project is to utilize the HyperNEAT evolutionary algorithm to test the impact upon evolution when a cost of morphological complexity is imposed. More specifically, this project aims to investigate the impact that an imposed cost of morphological complexity has upon robot task performance, evolved morphology, and the relationships these outcomes have with differing task-environment difficulty.</p>
		<p>These research objectives were motivated largely by ongoing research and previous results. These previous results have come to different conclusions regarding how different forms of morphological complexity evolves as a function of differing tasks and environments, as well as differently evolved robots in terms of resulting task performance and morphology. This work aims to examine the area from a new angle, by employing single-objective techniques to see if better mimicry of biological evolution can lead to noteworthy results.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Imposing a cost on complexity did, as intuition would suggest, reduce robot task performance, and also resulted in robots developing simpler morphologies. What is of interest here is that the tradeoff between morphology simplification and task performance, is not nearly one-to-one, and it was found that a reduction in robot morphology by half is associated with a reduction in task performance by only ~15%.</p>
        <p>As for the effect environment had on morphology with respect to the imposition of a complexity cost, most of the reduction in morphological complexity is attributed to the simpler difficulties, with a lesser difference being present at higher difficulty environments. It is also of note that when a cost is not imposed, robots naturally develop more complex morphologies within simpler environments, than in more difficult ones.</p>
        <p>In terms of task performance with regards to environment difficulty, the loss in task performance when a cost is imposed upon complexity can largely be attributed to the higher difficulty environments, with a difference of nearly 30%. The difference between simple environment means is only ~4%.</p>

			<h2>Background and Context</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The choice of Evolutionary Algorithm can play a big role in outcome of results when used. As such, the testing of a hypothesis involving an evolutionary algorithm should be tested again, using a different one, to ensure that the choice of algorithm didn't influence the results of the experiment. HyperNEAT is an evolutionary algorithm that uses the unique geometric properties of the problem, in tandem with it's indirect encoding (through CPPNs) to produce much larger networks than other algorithms.</p>
		<p>It has been observed that there is far more work that has been done in experimenting with co-evolving controllers/behaviour (minds) and morphology for single robots and much less work has been done for cooperative or multi-robot systems. The choice of investigating a multi-robot problem was thus to broaden this field and promote additional interest in this particular area.</p>

			<h2>Project Goals</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The aim of this project is to utilize the HyperNEAT evolutionary algorithm to test the impact upon evolution when a cost of morphological complexity is imposed. More specifically, this project aims to investigate the impact that an imposed cost of morphological complexity has upon robot task performance, evolved morphology, and the relationships these outcomes have with differing task-environment difficulty.</p>
		<p>These research objectives were motivated largely by ongoing research and previous results. These previous results have come to different conclusions regarding how different forms of morphological complexity evolves as a function of differing tasks and environments, as well as differently evolved robots in terms of resulting task performance and morphology. This work aims to examine the area from a new angle, by employing single-objective techniques to see if better mimicry of biological evolution can lead to noteworthy results.</p>
